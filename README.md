# Ember-frontend

Just wanted to start using Ember again, I always liked Ember.
When I started learning it, they had a lot of breaking builds
and I got frustrated and waited until the project got stable.
Well, time got away from me and I'm taking advantage of some free
time to get reacquainted with Ember!
